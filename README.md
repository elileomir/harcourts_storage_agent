2. **Replace the target section** with the chatbot HTML
3. **Include the CSS** in your website's stylesheet
4. **Include the JavaScript** in your website's scripts
5. **Update the webhook URL** if needed

### 3. Customization

Update the webhook URL in `script.js`:
```javascript
const WEBHOOK_URL = 'https://hup.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/80351e0b-d9ed-4380-81d7-c8f284e566f4/chat';

```

#### Styling
Modify colors, fonts, and layout in `styles.css` to match your website's theme.

  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-02T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```
